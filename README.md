## Overview :writing_hand:
Rica App is a web application developed using React and Sass that allows you, as a customer, to place delivery orders from your favorite restaurant within the app. You can also make reservations at your preferred restaurant. As a restaurant owner, you can efficiently manage products, offering functionalities to add, edit, delete, and view products. The app includes forms for adding and editing products, as well as a table displaying registered products. Finally, as an app administrator, you have the capability to manage both customers and restaurants.
The application connects to a backend API developed in Express to handle data. This repository contains the frontend structure. Here is the link to the backend repository: [Backend Repository](https://github.com/Cristianjs93/back-app-restaurant), and the link to the deployed application on Vercel: [Deployed Project]()."

### The Challenge :weight_lifting_man:

The main challenge of this project is to develop a web application that allows efficient management of products, deliveries, reservations, and the creation of unique users. Key functionalities include:

* User creation based on roles (ADMIN, RESTAURANT, CLIENT)
* Add products: Use the form to add new products to the restaurant's database through the backend API.
* Edit products: Modify information of existing products in the restaurant using the form and update the changes through the API.
* Delete products: Delete products from the restaurant's database via the API with a single click.
* View products: The table displays the registered products in the restaurant obtained from the API in a clear and organized manner.
* As a customer, we should also be able to add, edit, update, and/or delete products from the order to be registered. Additionally, we should be able to cancel both a delivery and a reservation."
